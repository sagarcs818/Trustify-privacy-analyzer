**Trustify** is an AI-powered web platform that helps users understand and evaluate the privacy policies of mobile apps and websites.  
Most users **blindly accept privacy policies** without reading how their personal data is collected, used, stored, or shared.

Trustify retrieves privacy policies of **listed applications** and analyzes potential **data-tracking risks**. If an application is not listed, users can paste the privacy policy manually for analysis. The platform then presents the results in a clear dashboard with a **Consent Risk Score, Safety Rating, and key privacy disclosures with short contextual descriptions** showing where those practices appear in the policy, helping users make informed privacy decisions.

# 🔄 System Workflow Explanation

### 1️⃣ User Search & Input
User searches for an application name (e.g., **WhatsApp**) or pastes a custom privacy policy.

### 2️⃣ Conditional Policy Retrieval
System checks if the application exists in the internal list.

- **Known App** → Privacy policy fetched using scraping tools  
- **Unknown App** → User pastes the privacy policy manually

### 3️⃣ Text Preprocessing
Raw text is processed using:

- Tokenization  
- Stopword removal  
- Text cleaning  

### 4️⃣ Sentiment Analysis & Keyword Detection
The NLP engine:

- Detects risky or aggressive clauses  
- Extracts sensitive permission keywords (Location, Contacts, Microphone, etc.)

### 5️⃣ Score Calculation & Results
The system generates:

- **Privacy Risk Score**
- **Safety Rating**

Results are displayed with **graphs and visual dashboards**.
